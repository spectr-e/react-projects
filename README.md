# 30+ React Projects

## Project 01: E-Signature App

This project seeks to create a simple signature application that is going to record one's name and the date or vice versa depending on which order you're writing them in.

In this project, we are going to use _useState_ which is a React Hook and we are also going to do some inline styles, styles as variables, and how we can use functions in JSX.

## Project 02: Randomizer Color App

Welcome to the color randomizer application. In this application, you will learn how to create and use a couple of buttons. Also, you will learn how to use the _Math_ function in React and how to hook up buttons with callback functions that when triggered, will randomize different colors.

It will also randomize different the background color and the title color.

## Project 03: Like My Photo App

In this project you will learn how to use clicks and double clicks and also how to integrate react icons into applications. We will also learn how to use the _useState_ hook to keep a record of the number of likes a photo has received.

## Project 04: Testimonials App

In this project, you will learn how to use _useEffect_ hook which is going to allow you to get API requests or fetch requests from a mock server.

We will use a JSON placeholder server as our source of data. We will fetch some posts and put them in a card. We will also fetch some users with their email addresses as well as their comments depending on their ID and email address.

We will also create new components (buttons) allowing us to insert text and icons in the component as well as have its own click event in each of them.

Lastly, we will employ _useState_ hook to manage the state of the component.

## Project 05: Alerts App

In this project, you will learn how to create alerts through an alert component.

There will be three (3) alerts one of which will disappear after a delay of approximately 3 seconds.

You will also be able to click on an alert and it disappears completely. They will also disappear all at once after a delay.

We will employ _useState_ and _useEffect_ hooks to manage the state of the component.
